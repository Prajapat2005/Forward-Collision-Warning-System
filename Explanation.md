### Python Code for FCW using YOLOv8/YOLOv10 for Object Detection

We'll use the `ultralytics` library, which provides access to pre-trained YOLO models for easy object detection. Below is the complete code that loads the video feed, performs object detection, and initiates braking based on closeness to detected objects.

#### Requirements
Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless ultralytics numpy
```

#### Explanation

- **Frame Processing**: Each frame is resized and fed into the YOLO model for efficient object detection.
- **Object Detection**: The model detects objects, filtering specifically for cars.
- **Distance and Speed Calculation**: Relative distance is estimated based on object size and confidence score. The `calculate_relative_speed` function should ideally get data from a vehicleâ€™s sensors.
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**: Computed as `distance / relative speed`. If TTC is below the safety threshold, a warning or braking action is triggered.
- **Visualization**: Bounding boxes are drawn around detected cars, with real-time distance and TTC labels.

### Simulation and Validation

1. **Simulation Environment**: The code can be tested in a simulated ADAS environment using CARLA or GAZEBO.
2. **Validation**: 
   - Test under different distances and speeds.
   - Adjust `DISTANCE_THRESHOLD` and `TTC_THRESHOLD` for accurate warning.
